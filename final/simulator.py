"""
A 12-vector representing the current configuration of the robot (3 variables for the chassis configuration, 5 variables for the arm configuration, and 4 variables for the wheel angles).
A 9-vector of controls indicating the wheel speeds u (4 variables) and the arm joint speeds \dot{\theta} (5 variables).
A timestep Î”t.
A positive real value indicating the maximum angular speed of the arm joints and the wheels. For example, if this value is 12.3, the angular speed of the wheels and arm joints is limited to the range [-12.3 radians/s, 12.3 radians/s]. Any speed in the 9-vector of controls that is outside this range will be set to the nearest boundary of the range. If you don't want speed limits, just use a very large number. If you prefer, your function can accept separate speed limits for the wheels and arm joints.
